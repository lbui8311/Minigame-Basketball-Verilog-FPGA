# Minigame-Basketball-Verilog-FPGA
COMPE-470L/475 Digital Logic & Microprocessors

# Description
This project aims to create a basketball minigame that will use a four-digit seven-segment display for the scoreboard of two players and a pseudo-random numbers generator (LFSR) as the core scoring algorithm (Verilog FPGA). The LFSR will run for three cycles to accommodate 3 bits shifting (zero to seven, or eight possible values). Each player will be assigned a random seed at the beginning, and the seed will be xor consecutively for randomness. Each scoring option will have a division factor that determines the success rate.
